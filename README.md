    source activate pytorch_p36

b. Clone the mmdetection repository.
    
    git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git
    
c. Install mmcv.

    pip install mmcv-full==1.0.5
    
d. Enter mmdetection directory to install build requirements and then install mmdetection.

    cd mmdetection
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install
    python setup.py develop
    
    
## Install Java and Tomcat

You can follow instructions in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=_d-c9uGcUrU) on how to deploy a Java web application on AWS EC2 instance using Tomcat, or read the instructions below.

a. Install java following the [official guide](https://java.com/en/download/help/linux_x64_install.xml).

For Deep Learning AMI, Java has already been installed.

b. Download the Tomcat Binary from the [official site](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi). For example, you can download the core tar.gz file and untar it.

    wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.57/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.57.tar.gz
    tar xvfz apache-tomcat-8.5.57.tar.gz
    
c. If you are using Deep Learning AMI, you need to remove restrictions set by both Tomcat and AWS so that you can have access to the server on a remote machine.

First modify the file `apache-tomcat-8.5.57/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml`. You can see a `Valve` tag within the `Context` tag. It might look like this:
    
    <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
        
Command out this line so that the `Context` tag becomes

    <Context antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
        <!-- <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->
        <Manager sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="java\.lang\.(?:Boolean|Integer|Long|Number|String)|org\.apache\.catalina\.filters\.CsrfPreventionFilter\$LruCache(?:\$1)?|java\.util\.(?:Linked)?HashMap"/>
    </Context>

Then go to your EC2 dashboard and click on the `Security Group` link on the far right of instance, and add a new inbound rule to allow for access to port 8080. Specifically, click `Inbound rules` card tag, then click `Edit inbound rules` -> `Add rules`. Select Type `Custom TCP`, Port range `8080`, and Source `Custom`, `0.0.0.0/0`. Then click on `Save rules`.

d. Set up username and password as app manager on Tomcat. Modify file `apache-tomcat-8.5.57/conf/tomcat-users.xml` and append user configuration to the file. For example, you can add the following line right before the closing tag `</tomcat-users>`.

    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
      <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui"/>
      

## Install the table extraction web application
     
a. Clone this github repository. We saved the folder at path `/home/ubuntu/`. You need to modify all python files to replace this path with your own if you saved the folder in another directory. Then download the checkpoint file from this link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z21BLmpF-3RgOBrEogRbg0uNZCkMX-Ez/view?usp=sharing` and put it in the github repository.

b. Go to your Apache Tomcat directory and then go to `bin/` folder. Run the following command in your shell to start the Tomcat server:

    ./startup.sh
    
c. Type in the public DNS of your instance in your browser with port 8080, i.e., `ec2-xxxxxxxx.amazonaws.com:8080`, and you can see the front page of Tomcat server. Click on `Manager App` button and enter the username and password you have just set up. In the `Deploy` section, enter the absolute path to `.war` file in this repository in `Contect Path (required)`, then click on `Deploy` button.

d. After deploying the application, you can find the corresponding url of this app in the dashboard. You can then enter `ec2-xxxxxxxx.amazonaws.com:8080/AppName` to visit the webpage and use our product.

e. After you have finished work on the product, go to your Apache Tomcat directory and then go to `bin/` folder. Run `./shutdown.sh` to stop the Tomcat server.
